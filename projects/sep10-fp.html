            <p>Throughout the whole year in the Software Engineering Program (SEP) students mainly had two goals, gaining personal improvement, and learning…how to learn? This may sound obscure and at first glance so did I but after further consideration, you realize how important it is to learn. Sometimes we humans don't fully understand what learning means and rely on others to do the learning for us but, for us it was different. We were in the driving seat</p>
            <p>Now that we were in the driving seat we had an endless amount of ideas that were possible to explore. I chose Construction as talked about before and now it was finally time to present and explain my reason and ideas behind why I chose construction technology and why my tool is so impactful for our future. Before I talk about how my presentation went and what I explained to everyone, let's talk about the creation and build-up of my slides and presentation! The first thing I had to accomplish like websites, was having a wireframe/plan but m, more specifically, a template for my slides. I looked for something that could relate to my tool and my idea so the first thing I searched up on https://slidesgo.com/ was “construction green”. I searched this up and found the perfect template that showed and had a nice construction vibe, colors that went well with each other, and it even had some images that reminded me of A-frame which is also my tool! This was the perfect template for me.</p>

            <p>This was the slides template I chose. Once I had this I needed a hook and I really wanted it to circulate my main problem which was a time shortage when making plans for the future. I decided to have my hook for a little game of questions. I decided I would show three structures: a building, a house, and a bridge, then I would ask everyone as a class how they are similar to each other. Once answers were said and shared I gave my answer which was the problem, I stated how they all take a ton of time to plan and create. Once I did this I decided to show my solution which was my website and what it was going to contain.</p>
            <p>Once I had this planned I gave my inspiration which if you were wondering, is Minecraft. My website is oddly similar to Minecraft apart from mien being used hopefully in the real world. I used and said this to intrigue people and make them interested because of my inspiration (since many people love and play Minecraft). Once I did this and continuously explained the difficulties and codes I came up with then all of a sudden… My presentation ended. It went well but more than that the feedback I received was what I looked for, many compliments but also people's curious about my topic in a good way. I wanted to challenge their minds while also enjoying it.  </p>
            <p>My takeaway from this project was that I really enjoyed working on my slides and having to organize them on my own. I enjoyed doing this project while working with others that gave me feedback on my work and what they thought was best for my project. Some difficulties I had to face when creating my slides and project were the main structure of it. I knew what I wanted just that I had difficulties with a shortage of slides and a possible short presentation. Once I realized this I saw that I had to add more lines and be more calm and subtle about my presentation. I wanted to get the attention of my audience and make it an interesting project. It went well and was overall fun.</p>
